Women Empowerment
====================

A Web Platform to help empower women through skill development.

The platform admins can list various events for skill development under government and private initiatives and interested women candidates can enroll for the events. Every time a new event is added to the platform, the system notifies eligible registered women candidates about the events so that they can register to it.

The platform also sends reminder for events on the eve, uploads course complete certificates to system which can be downloaded by users from their profile page.

The platform also provides details about the NGO, Annai Educational Trust which is driving this wonderful initiative to empower women.

## Some of the key features supported by the platform:

``` bash
1. User Registration and Login
2. Add Events (Admin Functionality)
3. Generate reports
4. Notify users of upcoming events.
5. Upload certificates of course completion (Admin functionality)
6. Download certificates feature for women post course completion.
7. Auto detect eligible candidates for events.
8. Details about the NGO - Annai Educational Trust
9. Trustees, Donation and Contact information of trust.
```

## Application Tech Stack

We're intending to develop this application over Spring MVC as web framework, Mongo DB as database and HTML/CSS/JS for front end. We intend to build the application in a single component deployment model considering the maintainability aspect of application since the NGO trustees are from non IT background.
